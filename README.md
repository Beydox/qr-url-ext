## Features

- **Generate QR code** for any link on the page.
- Modern and responsive interface built with **Material-UI (MUI)** 
- Links are processed locally without being sent to any server
- **How it works:** right-click on the link, then click on the extension icon in the context menu
- **To get QR code** open Extension's popup window
- **Manifest V3** compatibility.
